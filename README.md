# Word Guessing Game

Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! This beginner-level Unity project is focused on basic scripting and user interaction to help players learn while having fun.

## Description

The objective of the game is to guess the correct word by revealing letters. The words are selected from a list of Armenian names, and the player has a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed. If the player runs out of attempts before guessing the word, they lose. If they guess correctly, they win!

## Features

- **Word Pool**: Uses a list of Armenian names as the words to guess.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players are allowed a fixed number of incorrect guesses.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides feedback for both correct and incorrect letter guesses.

## Getting Started

1. Open in Unity (version 2021.3.27f1 LTS or later).
2. Press play to run.

## How to Play

- Guess letters by entering them using the keyboard. The game will provide feedback to indicate whether the guessed letter is correct or not.
- Try to reveal the word before running out of attempts.
- Use the feedback to see which letters are correct and incorrect.
